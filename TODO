* Add mw and mr, which also use sameobject
* Bolt-on consistency: Add explicit causal visibility (excv) relation: a --excv--> b. Add assertion:
    + hb = excv; vis; so*
		+ hb \cap sameobject \subseteq vis
	* Add hb from (forall_ a in initWrites) to (forall_ a notin initwrites)
	* Add hb clause for readsFrom
* Add transaction support.
